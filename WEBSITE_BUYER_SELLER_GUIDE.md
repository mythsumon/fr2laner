requireAuth("buyer"); // Redirects if not buyer
requireAuth("seller"); // Redirects if not seller
requireAuth("admin"); // Redirects if not admin
```

### Route Protection

**Homepage to Category:**
```typescript
// Uses getCategoryUrl() utility
import { getCategoryUrl } from "@/components/shared/utils";

<Link href={getCategoryUrl(categoryName)}>
  {categoryName}
</Link>
```

### Dynamic Routes

**Service Detail:**
- Route: `/services/[id]`

## Best Practices

### 1. Authentication Checks

Always check authentication before accessing protected routes:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && !user) {
    requireAuth("buyer");
  }
}, [isLoading, user, requireAuth]);
```

### 2. Loading States

Show loading indicators during async operations:
```typescript
if (isLoading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}
```

### 3. Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully:
```typescript
try {
  await operation();
} catch (error) {
  showToast(error.message, "error");
}
```

### 4. User Feedback

Provide feedback for all user actions:
```typescript
showToast("주문이 완료되었습니다.", "success");
showToast("오류가 발생했습니다.", "error");
```

### 5. Responsive Design

Always test on multiple screen sizes:
- Use Tailwind responsive classes
- Test mobile navigation
- Verify touch targets

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot Access Buyer/Seller Dashboard

**Solutions:**
1. Verify user is logged in
2. Check user role in localStorage
3. Verify route protection in layout file
4. Check authentication redirect logic

### Issue: Navigation Not Working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Link components from Next.js
2. Check route paths are correct
3. Verify useRouter hook is imported
4. Check for route conflicts

### Issue: Data Not Persisting

**Solutions:**
1. Check localStorage is enabled
2. Verify data is being saved
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Implement proper API integration

### Issue: Responsive Layout Issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check Tailwind breakpoints
2. Verify mobile navigation components
3. Test on actual devices
4. Check viewport meta tag

---

## Development Tips

### Adding a New Buyer Page

1. Create page: `app/(buyer)/{page-name}/page.tsx`
2. Create component: `components/page/buyer/{page-name}/`
3. Add to buyer layout navigation
4. Implement authentication check
5. Add to mobile bottom nav if needed

### Adding a New Seller Page

1. Create page: `app/(seller)/dashboard/{page-name}/page.tsx`
2. Create component: `components/page/seller/{page-name}/`
3. Add to seller layout navigation
4. Implement authentication check
5. Add to mobile bottom nav if needed

### Adding a New Public Page

1. Create page: `app/{page-name}/page.tsx`
2. Create component: `components/page/{page-name}/`
3. Add to header navigation if needed
4. No authentication required

---

## API Integration (Future)

When integrating with backend API:

### Replace Mock Data

```typescript
// Instead of:
const services = mockServices;

// Use:
const { data: services } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['services'],
  queryFn: () => fetch('/api/services').then(res => res.json())
});
```

### Implement Real Authentication

```typescript
// Instead of localStorage:
const login = async (email, password) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
  });
  const { token, user } = await response.json();
  // Store token securely
};
```

### Real-time Updates

```typescript
// Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://api.example.com');
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  updateState(data);
};
```
